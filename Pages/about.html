    <h1>My History</h1>
    <div class="history-box">
    <p>I’ve been in love with the art of cosmetics for as long as I can remember. I was born in Kingston, Jamaica, to my mother, a hairdresser. She often told me she believed her love for all things beauty and fashion had been passed down to me. When I moved to Ireland at the age of 5 this became incredibly important to me. It was difficult to find a salon I could visit as my wild and curly hair wasn’t the norm and my mother wouldn’t always be around, so I had to learn to handle it myself.<br>As I became more confident in my work I began sharing my work online. With luck, one of my posts went viral, opening the door to a world of opportunities I never knew existed.<br>I was able to collaborate with influential figures in the beauty industry as a mentee while I worked towards my cosmetology certification. With all the love and support I received especially on my ever growing social media, I was encouraged to open my own salon. The journey has been long but so worthwhile and I hope my vision can be shared across the globe.</p>

    <h1>How my beauty career began</h1>
    <div class="career-box">
        <p> I started posting makeup looks and hairstyles platforming my diverse skillset and creative vision from my tiny accommodation in xxx. With luck and the power of the internet was able to go viral. After a lot of anticipation, we are finally here. My team and I blend creativity with personal style to craft a one-of-a-kind experience for every client.When I was in cosmetology school, I noticed my classes primarily focused on looser hair and finer features, but I had a different idea in mind. I wanted one space where all hair types and features could be appreciated. So, I set out to create it!.</p>
